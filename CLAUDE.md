# ASCENITH RAIDZONE

Community website + Discord bot for an *Once Human* community that runs custom
servers, tournaments and hands out sponsored prizes. Public showcase site,
player self-service area, staff portal, and a Discord bot — one Next.js app plus
a bot process, one Postgres DB.

Owner is **POTATOZIE**. Owner identity must stay invisible to non-owner staff
(see `src/lib/staff-mask.ts`).

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** App Router, TypeScript, React 19. `type: module`.
- **Prisma 6** + PostgreSQL. Migrations are hand-written SQL (see below).
- **Auth.js v5 beta** — **Discord OAuth only**. No email/password (removed). JWT
  sessions. `src/auth.ts` (full) + `src/auth.config.ts` (edge-safe, for middleware).
- **discord.js 14** bot in `src/bot/` (run with `tsx`). Web talks to Discord via
  REST helpers in `src/lib/discord.ts` (bot token); the bot process handles slash
  commands / autocomplete / the reminder loop.
- **Tailwind v3**. Neutral-black palette; tokens: `void`, `panel`, `panel-2`,
  `edge`, `cream`, `slate` (zinc ramp), `teal` (the crimson accent `#e5484d`),
  `ember`. The landing (`src/app/page.tsx` → `src/components/landing/`) keeps its
  **own warm palette** in `landing.module.css` — don't unify them.
- `sharp` for image processing. Uploaded images (`MediaAsset`) are stored as
  bytes in Postgres and served from `/api/media/[id]`.

## Layout

```
src/app/
  page.tsx                 landing (its own design system, GSAP scroll FX)
  (site)/                   public + player area, shares SiteHeader/Footer/ScrollReveal
    events|teams|factions|seasons|winners|rules|about   public showcase pages
    me/                     player self-service (auth required)
    portal/                 staff (RBAC — see src/lib/rbac.ts)
  icon.png / apple-icon.png / opengraph-image.png / twitter-image.png
  sitemap.ts / robots.ts   force-dynamic (read runtime NEXTAUTH_URL)
src/bot/                    discord.js worker; commands.ts, reminders.ts, deploy-commands.ts
src/lib/                    db, auth helpers, discord REST, rbac, validation (zod), ...
prisma/schema.prisma + migrations/ + seed.ts
```

Showcase pages share the broadsheet `PageMasthead` and put `data-reveal` on
sections for the `ScrollReveal` fade-in (scoped to `.site-shell`, so the landing
is never touched).

## RBAC

`src/lib/rbac.ts` — roles `OWNER > ADMIN > MODERATOR`. `can(role, permission)`.
Server actions call `assertPermission(...)` (`src/lib/guard.ts`, throws); pages
call `requirePermission(...)` (`src/lib/session.ts`, redirects). Every staff
mutation writes an `AuditLog` row via `logAudit(...)`; viewer at `/portal/audit`.

## Domain notes

- **Player vs User** — `User` = auth identity, `Player` = community profile. A
  `Player` (status `PENDING`) is auto-created on every sign-in so staff see
  everyone; it flips to `ACTIVE` when the profile is completed.
- **Teams** — player-made, **one per event**, for `format: TEAM` events. Distinct
  from **Factions** (staff-defined houses / persistent allegiance, with an
  optional Discord role per house; `syncMemberRoles` reconciles roles).
- **Factions page** (`/factions`) is scoped to the **Faction War** season series
  (any `Season.series` containing "faction"). Team-event podiums are NOT rolled
  into factions. Titles matched champion-name → faction-name fuzzily.
- **Events → Discord** — "Build space" creates a category + channel set; content
  is pushed per channel. `announcement / how-to-join / rules / wipe-info` are
  read-only (locked *after* seeding, with a bot send-override). `announcePing` /
  `announcePingAll` control `@everyone`. "Repost + ping" deletes & reposts to
  re-fire pings. Archive replaces every child channel's overwrites so nothing
  shows to members.
- **Notifications** — players get Discord DMs (waitlist promotion, reward
  granted, event starting) unless `Player.dmNotifications` is off. `src/lib/notify.ts`.

## Migrations

Hand-write the SQL. `prisma migrate deploy` runs on web container boot (then
`db:seed`, non-fatal). To add one: edit `schema.prisma`, create
`prisma/migrations/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<name>/migration.sql` with plain `ALTER`
statements, run `npx prisma generate`. Additive columns only where possible.

## Commands

```
npm run dev          # next dev
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit  (app) + tsc -p src/bot/tsconfig.json (bot)
npm run build        # prisma generate && next build
npm run bot          # tsx src/bot/index.ts
npm run db:seed
```

Always `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx next build` before committing. Lint is strict
(`no-html-link-for-pages` — use `<Link>` for internal hrefs, `prefetch={false}`
for route handlers that download).

## Deploy

Self-hosted VPS, Docker Compose at `/opt/ascenith/` (compose file lives on the
server, not in the repo). One image, two services (`web` + `bot`). The web
service runs `prisma migrate deploy` + seed on boot; the bot re-registers slash
commands on boot.

Redeploy: `git archive --format=tar.gz -o repo.tar.gz HEAD`, scp to
`/opt/ascenith/`, then `rm -rf repo && mkdir repo && tar -xzf repo.tar.gz -C repo
&& ./deploy.sh`. Public URL is an nginx vhost on the box — **do not touch other
services on that shared VPS.**

Site metadata (`metadataBase`, sitemap, robots) reads `NEXTAUTH_URL` at runtime —
that's why the landing, sitemap and robots are `force-dynamic`.
